gpios:

cooler1:      PWM2:  22
cooler2:      PWM3:  19
internal fan: PWM4:  23
external fan: PWM5:  18
power enable: Relay: 13
ds18B20: 25
ADC temperature: 32

We've also set
gpio12: high (so a spare 3.3v power supply for DS18B20
gpio33: low for spare 0v reference for temperature header

and defined these PWMs that map to real pins, that we nevertheless
don't use, only allowing them as an easy persistent store/recall for
the PID parameters:

thermostat (user slider input, not real): PWM1: 17 ; write to channel2
PID Pb:                                   PWM6: 16 ; write to pwm6
PID Ti:                                   PWM7: 15 ; write to pwm7
PID Td:                                   PWM8: 14 ; write to pwm8
